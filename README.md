# The Algorithm

1. Initialize circle_points, square_points and interval to 0.
2. Generate random point x.
3. Generate random point y.
4. Calculate d = x*x + y*y.
5. If d <= 1, increment circle_points.
6. Increment square_points.
7. Increment interval.
8. If increment < NO_OF_ITERATIONS, repeat from 2.
9. Calculate pi = 4\*(circle_points/square_points).

The code doesnâ€™t wait for any input via stdin as the macro INTERVAL could be changed as per the required number of iterations. Number of iterations are the square of INTERVAL.
